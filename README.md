# axltoolkit by Paul Giralt

This is a Python-based Toolkit for Unified CM AXL and SXML Frameworks. It is very much incomplete, but should get anyone interested in leveraging these API's enough to get started and build upon. 

Modify the credentials.py file with your UCM AXL and Platform Credentials to be able to try out the scripts. For production usage, I would recommend using some more secure way of storing credentials. 

The samples folder contains four sample scripts that will show you how to use the toolkit:

sample1_axl: Example of Thick and Thin AXL

sample2_ris: Example of the RisPort SXML API to retrieve a list of IP addresses of registered phones

sample3_perfmon: Example of Perfmon SXML API to retrieve some Perfmon Counters

sample4_paws: Example of the Hardware Information PAWS API
